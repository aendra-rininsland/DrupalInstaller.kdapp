# Koding Drupal Installer

Based on WordpressInstaller by Gokmen Goksel (@gokmen)
 
## To use:
In a Koding terminal, type the following:                                                                                                   
`git clone https://github.com/aendrew/DrupalInstaller.kdapp ~/Applications/DrupalInstaller.kdapp`                                           
 
Or search for "aendrew" using Koding's excellent Github Dashboard app to install directly.                                                  
 
Note: Be a bit careful if you've used @gokmen's WordPress installer -- I'm not sure if I've                                                 
properly changed the dashboard namespace, and app namespaces are global.                                                                    
 
Currently a work-in-progress.
 
### TODO
 
+ Make icons and other media work.
