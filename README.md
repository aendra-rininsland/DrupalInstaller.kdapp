# Koding Drupal Installer

by [Ændrew Rininsland](http://www.aendrew.com) ([@aendrew](http://www.koding.com/aendrew))
 
Based on WordpressInstaller by Gökmen Göksel ([@gokmen](http://www.koding.com/gokmen))
 
## To use:
In a Koding terminal, type the following:                                                                                                   
`git clone https://github.com/aendrew/DrupalInstaller.kdapp.git ~/Applications/DrupalInstaller.kdapp`                                           
 
Or search for "aendrew" using Koding's excellent [Dashboard for Github](https://koding.com/Apps/github-dashboard) app to install directly.                                                  

Currently a work-in-progress. Having problems? Please add them to the [issue queue](https://github.com/aendrew/DrupalInstaller.kdapp/issues)!

### TODO
 
+ Make icons and other media work.
